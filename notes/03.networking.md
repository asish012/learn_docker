**Quick check which ports of the container are open**
> docker container port <container>

- When we run a docker container, we connect the container with a docker network (default bridge network).
- Best practice is to create a new virtual network for each application. So that they don't need to expose their ports to the host or other network with "-p" command.

* You can skip docker's virtual network for good and use host's IP using --net=host

- You can also use 3rd party network drivers to enable new abilities

- By default docker container doesn't use host's IP address.
